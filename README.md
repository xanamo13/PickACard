This is my first time making something with Kotlin. It was very fun, and I do plan to update this little app more. I think it was okay for the amount of time I spent on it, which was probably around 80 hours, though I'm not exactly sure as I wasn't very focused on how long I was working on it. I know it was at least 4 hours each programming session. 

Things I want to add: 
  - Feature where user can add or delete their own "cards"
  - Feature where user can customize cards
  - Feature where user can actually "choose" a card, and they get a celebratory screen or animation of some kind.
  - Different card decks

I think the customization of cards can make it way more fun, since theoretically the user would be able to make their own little "cards against humanity"-esque game. Or maybe those silly little things where they add their friends names and make nonsensical sentences. 

It is really just meant to be a bordeom buster app. It isn't meant to be anything very serious, though I do think there could be different uses for it beyond "what food should I eat today". 

Overall, this was a fun experience and I would love to work with Kotlin and JetPack Compose more in the future!
